# Deploy to GitHub - Step by Step Guide

## Current Status

âœ… Git repository initialized
âœ… All files added and committed
âœ… Ready for GitHub deployment

## Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" button and select "New repository"
3. Name it: `artwithheartandgifts` or `art-with-heart-and-gifts`
4. Make it **Public** (for Vercel deployment)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/artwithheartandgifts.git

# Push the main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After pushing:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Verify all files are there (should see api/, public/, src/, etc.)
3. Check that there's no .github/workflows/ directory (we removed Wix deployment)

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect it's a static site with serverless functions
4. Add environment variables:
   - `EMAIL_USER` = artwithheartandgiftsllc@gmail.com
   - `EMAIL_PASS` = [your-gmail-app-password]
   - `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` = artwithheartandgifts@yahoo.com
   - `NODE_ENV` = production
